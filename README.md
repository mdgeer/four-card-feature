# Four Card Feature w/Flexbox
New to all this coding stuff. Literally learned about Flexbox before tackling this challenge from Frontend Mentor. Then I learned about CSS Grid a couple of days later and realized that using the grid probably would have been better.   I didn't have the design file for this, so this was done using only an image of the final result. Think I did okay, but open to feedback :)
